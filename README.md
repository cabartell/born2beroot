# Born2beRoot

## Prerequisites
The VM is setup with partitions correctly and is working


## Setting up *sudo* 

### Install *sudo*
From root, Install *sudo* with
```
$ apt install sudo
```
Check if *sudo* was installed successfully with
```
$ apt-cache policy sudo
```

### Add user to *sudo* group
Add `<username>` to *sudo* group with
```
$ adduser <username> sudo  
```
if `adduser` command does not work, you may need to add it to PATH like so
```
PATH=$PATH:/usr/sbin/
```
Check users in *sudo* group with
```
$ getent group sudo  
```
Now `reboot`and login.
Now you can use `sudo` instead if switching to root.

```
$ sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
